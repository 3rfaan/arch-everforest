## 🎨 Installation

```sh
ya pack -a yazi-rs/flavors:catppuccin-macchiato
```

## ⚙️ Usage

Set the content of your `theme.toml` to enable it as your _dark_ flavor:

```toml
[flavor]
use = "catppuccin-macchiato"
# For upcoming Yazi 0.4 (nightly version):
dark = "catppuccin-macchiato"
```

Make sure your `theme.toml` doesn't contain anything other than `[flavor]`, unless you want to override certain styles of this flavor.
